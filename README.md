# ComputerArchitectureCourse

Welcome to the Computer Architecture course !


This course aims at introducing the concept of Computer Architecture. It mostly focuses on MIPS architecture whereas topics such as Computer Arithmetic, Pipelining,  and I/O Organisation are given utmost attention. The course also features lab tutorials mostly based upon MIPS Assembly and also this course contains resources and materials for the Computer Architecture, providing an in-depth exploration of the fundamental principles and design concepts that govern the organization and operation of computer systems, more specifically with the RISC-V architecture and MIPS architecture.

RISC-V offers a unique set of features that allow users to customize and optimize both software and hardware for specific use cases, resulting in faster development cycles and better design tradeoffs for performance, power and area.

MIPS (Million Instruction Per Second)  is a type of microprocessor architecture that utilizes a  RISC (reduced instruction set computing) approach. In simpler terms, it's a way of organizing how a computer's processor works, focusing on simplicity and speed. MIPS emphasizes high clock speed and efficient pipelining, making it ideal for high-throughput applications. Pipelining in MIPS is a technique used to improve the performance of the processor.
